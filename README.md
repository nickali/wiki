Hola.

I'm Nick. I'm a marketing technologist.

What is my definition of marketing technologist? I imagine a spectrum:

Marketing &lt;--------------------&gt; Technology

By marketing, I'm referring to the 4Ps and not something specific like digital advertising. By technology, I mean someone who understands marketing \(all 4Ps\) and technology \(languages, frameworks, APIs, toolchains, platforms, etc\) and can determine if, when , where, and how technology is used on that spectrum.

Honestly, I like to learn about human behavior. Marketing is a good way of doing that \(even though the industry is simply wacky a lot of the times\). This is a place to give structure to my own thoughts and notes.
