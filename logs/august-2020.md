Aug.19.2020 23:50 — Creating journal alias: alias journal='vi $\(echo ${\(L\)$\(date +%B-%Y\)}\).md' in .zshrc.

Aug.20.2020 17:47 — Rust must be first language I've seen complain about using camel case when I should be using snake case. Impressive.

Aug.28.2020 11:38 — Trying to set up tmux for the millionth time. It has way too many options to keep track of.
