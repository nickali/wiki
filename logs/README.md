# Logs

This is an experiment. There are many notes tools out there. I've used Evernote, Bear, Apple Notes, a bunch of different wikis, but they never stick. Plus my bookmarks are elsewhere. Plus I have text files all over the place tracking little bits of information. And todos in another different place. 

Too much chaos. 

When I'm pretending to work, I usually have a text editor open. Why not keep a running log here?

For starters, let's do one text file per month and see how that goes. Would be nice to keep a rolling 30 days of notes in one file but that seems difficult to implement. 

For the sake of simplicity, if something needs to be tagged, it either should be either \#work or \#personal.
