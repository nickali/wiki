# Desktop/Laptop Apps

I'm all in on Apple. I've bought iPhones, iPads, Watch, Apple TVs, Macbooks, iMacs, Mac Pros, Airport, Pencil, Magic Mice, and wireless keyboards. The only major Apple device I've never puchased is the Homepod.

I love Mac OS X even with all its warts. Microsoft interfaces make me 🤮a bit.

[I love me some yummy open source software](https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2008/11/20/ubuntu-hall-of-fame/). If an OSS piece of software is close to proprietary software, I'll use the OSS app instead.

Alright, let's do this.

## Media

* VLC - started using it years ago when all other media players sucked and have stuck with. The interface looks a bit dated, but it still works no matter what you throw at it.

## Internet-y

### Browsers

* Firefox - add some plugins and it becomes super secure. It's a bit of a resource hog on Apple products, but the sacrifice is worth it.
  * Plugins:
    * uMatrix - shows you which ads and trackers it blocked, and provides you to unblock resources or block even more files. \(no longer developed\)
    * Nitter - a different front-end of Twitter which is useful if you want to lookup specific accounts without going to Twitter directly or using an app. It's self-hosted or you can use a public instance.
    * Invidious - imagine nitter for YouTube.
    * Bibliogram - imagine Invidious for Instagram.

## Folders and Documents

* Cryptomator - encrypts files and folders and can mount folders so users can transparently encrypt everything dropped into the folder.
* Cyberduck - file transfer app but also has Cryptomator functionality built-in
* Moutain Duck - mounts network volumes, but also has Cryptomator functionality built-in.

## Utilities

* 1440 - A menubar app that let's you know the number of minutes left in the day. Great tool to remind you not to procrastinate.
* AppCleaner - It identifies the cruft that needs to be deleted when deleting an app. Usually they are settings file that do no harm by hanging around, but I'd prefer them gone.
* 1Password - Great UX and works flawlessly, but...
* Bitwarden - I didn't want all my super secret info sitting in the cloud. Bitwarden can be self-hosted.
* Hyper - an alternative to Terminal. Has themes and plugins \(and git integration\):

SaaS

* Paid: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, AT&T Now
* Self-hosted:

  * Nitter - a different front-end of Twitter which is useful if you want to lookup specific accounts without going to Twitter directly or using an app. It's self-hosted or you can use a public instance.
  * Invidious - imagine nitter for YouTube.
  * Bibliogram - imagine Invidious for Instagram.
  * Bitwarden\_rs - a password storage server for Bitwarden password manager apps.
